The Multiprotocol example application ([multi_gatewayd](https://github.com/MattAtAyla/device_linux_gw_public/tree/master/app/multi_gatewayd)) is not yet documented here. However, because it is a combination of [bt_gatewayd](https://github.com/MattAtAyla/device_linux_gw_public/tree/master/app/bt_gatewayd) and [zb_gatewayd](https://github.com/MattAtAyla/device_linux_gw_public/tree/master/app/zb_gatewayd), you can start with one of these, and then add code from the other.
