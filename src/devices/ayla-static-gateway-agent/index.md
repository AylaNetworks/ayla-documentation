(Compare this to the [Ayla Dynamic Gateway Agent](../ayla-dynamic-gateway-agent) which models each node as a separate digital twin in the Ayla Cloud.)

The Ayla Static Gateway Agent requires less hardware & software resources than its dynamic cousin, and is designed for solutions featuring a small, fixed number of nodes.
