This guide shows you how to connect a Linux-based (customer) application to the Ayla Cloud using the [Ayla Device Platform for Linux](http://localhost/glossary/ayla-device-platform-for-linux/) which includes the [Ayla Linux Agent](/glossary/ayla-linux-agent/). The guide uses an example customer application called appd running on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). 

Typically, these customer applications (1) control devices, or (2) communicate with other applications that control devices.
