This guide shows you how to connect a Linux-based (customer) application to the Ayla Cloud using the Ayla Device Platform for Linux which includes the Ayla Linux Agent. The guide uses an example customer application called appd running on a Raspberry Pi. Typically, applications that leverage an Ayla Linux Agent either (1) control devices, or (2) communicate with other applications that control devices.
