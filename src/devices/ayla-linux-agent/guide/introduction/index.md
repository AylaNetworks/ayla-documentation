This guide uses a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) connected via jumper wires to a breadboard (hosting a red LED and a black button) to represent any Linux-based device that you may want to connect to the [Ayla Cloud](/glossary/ayla-cloud). The guide refers to this RPi/breadboard combination as the RPi device. The Setup chapter provides instructions for setting up the RPi and breadboard.

The best way to connect the RPi device to the Ayla Cloud is to run an [Ayla Linux Agent](/glossary/ayla-linux-agent) on the device. The Ayla Linux Agent is part of the Ayla Device Platform for Linux (available on Github as [device_linux_public](https://github.com/AylaNetworks/device_linux_public)).
