This guide shows you how to connect a Linux-based host application (appd), running on a Raspberry Pi, to the Ayla Cloud using the Ayla Linux Agent (devd). Both appd and devd are part of the Ayla Device Platform for Linux (see [Glossary: Ayla Device Platform for Linux](/glossary/ayla-device-platform-for-linux)) which is hosted on Github as [device_linux_public](https://github.com/AylaNetworks/device_linux_public). Typically, applications that leverage an Ayla Linux Agent either (1) control devices, or (2) communicate with other applications that control devices.
