Use the HTML <code>img</code> tag to add an image to your page:

<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
&lt;img src="raspberry-pi.png" width="300"&gt;
</pre>

Here is what this particular image looks like:

<img src="raspberry-pi.png" width="300">

Note the following:

1. The width of an image is measured in pixels. 100 pixels equals one inch. 
1. Don't add any HTML styles or classes to your image. 
1. Don't wrap your image in any HTML tags. 
1. See [Lists](../lists) to learn how to intersperse images in lists.
