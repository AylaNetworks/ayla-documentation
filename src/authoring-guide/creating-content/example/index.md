This is an example index.md file.

All index.md files created for you will include key-value pairs similar to those between the hyphenated lines above. The publishing process uses these key-value pairs when converting markdown to HTML. In this example, you would replace "Example" with the title of your page, leaving the other key-value pairs untouched.

Below are writing tips:

1. Write direct prose.
1. Avoid repetition and wordiness.
1. Avoid emphasis with bold, italics, and underlining.
