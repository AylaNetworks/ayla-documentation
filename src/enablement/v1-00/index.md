## Creating enablement

In general, [enablement](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/enablement) is the action of giving someone the means to do something. For Ayla Docs, **someone** refers to Ayla users (prospects, customers, partners, and employees), and **something** refers, in way or another, to leveraging the Ayla Platform. 

Creating Enablement is an agile process that produces focused, <span style="color:red;">maintainable</span> enablement material rapidly:

1. Identify and describe (using [Bloom verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy)) what a user should be **able to do** as a result of enablement:

1. Write steps for each task on the provided [Ayla Docs page](https://docs.aylanetworks.com/tech-notes/00000007/). Start each step with a verb or a preposition.

1. Identify (using [Bloom verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy)) what a user should **know** in order to perform these tasks, and add definitions, explanations, and links to the page.  Send the page link to the customer, request feedback, and update. <span style="color:red;">The page is useful at this point</span>.

1. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 as needed.
1. Optionally, create short videos (1-2 min) for some tasks, and add them to the page:
