To obtain a kit, email <code>support&#64;aylanetworks.com</code> with the subject "Ayla Development Kit." Then, follow the guides:

**Step 2.** The [Developer Guide](developer-guide) helps you establish a Windows, Mac, or Linux development environment, download the Host Application Reference Code from the Ayla Github repository, and modify, build, flash, and run the code:

**Step 4.** The [Account Guide](account-guide) shows you how to work with Ayla Support to create an Ayla Customer Account for your company, migrate your user account, and receive additional access rights. Then, you can migrate your kit to the new account where you can explore OTA updates, business system integrations, and additional edge solutions.
