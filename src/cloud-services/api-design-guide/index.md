Ayla APIs are **important** because they enable software clients to access **revenue**-generating Ayla Cloud Services. So, to drive revenue, Ayla API designers always look at APIs from the perspective of the software client and the human being writing or maintaining the software client.

1. Ayla APIs are easy to learn and use because they look and behave the same as many other APIs throughout the industry.




So, to drive revenue, Ayla API design prioritizes the **client perspective** in the following ways:

1. Ayla APIs reflect industry best practices. Why? 

1. An API should be easy to learn. 


, and focuses on ease of use, robustness, and performance. 



focuses on optimizing the experience of the **human being** writing the software client. 




What makes an API easy and fun to use?

1. Learnability. 


1. Standard. Ayla API design adheres to industry-standard norms for two reasons. First, 



1. Predictability. Ayla APIs behave predictably because they adhere to industry-standard norms so that human beings 

should behave in predictable ways for human beings experienced 


Human beings experienced in creating software that accesses REST APIs from various vendors learn new APIs more rapidly when the new APIs behave in predictable ways adhere to industry-standard norms. 


creating software that accesses REST APIs learn new APIs more rapidly, and like them better, when the APIs 

An API should behave in a predictable way. 

Human beings who create software clients that access REST APIs 



, and strives to make using APIs easy and fun. The following list characterizes the client perspective



This page provides standards to foster client-centric API design.

# Principles

Ayla Cloud services 

 Software clients represent 

1. Client-centric. Because the purpose of an API is to enable a client to access a service, API design should 
1. Consistent. 
1. Independent. Ayla REST APIs are independent of client and server implementations.
