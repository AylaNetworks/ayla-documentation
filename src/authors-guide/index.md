This guide explains how to create and edit [Ayla Docs](https://docs.aylanetworks.com) content.

## Basics

[Ayla Docs](https://docs.aylanetworks.com) is a collection of webpages like the page you are reading now. Each page is associated with a [Github directory](https://github.com/AylaNetworks/ayla-documentation/tree/master/src/authors-guide) containing source files and a [Web Directory](https://docs.aylanetworks.com/authors-guide/) containing deployed files. Source files include [index.md](https://github.com/AylaNetworks/ayla-documentation/blob/master/src/authors-guide/index.md) (composed of [Github Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)), and any referenced files (e.g. image files). Deployed files include [index.html](https://docs.aylanetworks.com/authors-guide/index.html) (generated from [index.md](https://github.com/AylaNetworks/ayla-documentation/blob/master/src/authors-guide/index.md)), and copies of the referenced files. 

As an author, you work with the source files corresponding to your page. 






Authors do not create new pages. Rather, authors submit  . 

Here are examples:

1. I need to explain how firmware should handle ack-enabled properties.
1. I need to provide steps to about getting started with Ayla.
1. I need APIs added to the [API Browser](cloud-services/api-browser).
