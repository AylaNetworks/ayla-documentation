### About search

A document id and a document url must be generic. The index.html file at the location will redirect to the document with the current version. This is correct:

```
{
  "id" : "some-page-title",
  "type" : "add",
  "fields" : {
      "title" : "Ayla Development Kit",
      "url" : "https://docs.aylanetworks.com/some-page-title",
      "source_type" : "html",
      "summary" : "This is the summary.",
      "body" : ""
  }
}
```

This is not correct:

```
{
  "id" : "some-page-title-2019-06",
  "type" : "add",
  "fields" : {
      "title" : "Ayla Development Kit",
      "url" : "https://docs.aylanetworks.com/some-page-title-2019-06",
      "source_type" : "html",
      "summary" : "This is the summary.",
      "body" : ""
  }
}
```
