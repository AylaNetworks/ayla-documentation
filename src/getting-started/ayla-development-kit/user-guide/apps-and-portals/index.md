In addition to the [Aura Mobile App](/apps/aura-mobile-app), Ayla provides two web portals for device management, [Ayla Developer Portal](/apps/ayla-developer-portal) and [Ayla Dashboard Portal](/apps/ayla-dashboard-portal), illustrated in the diagram below:

The diagram also shows two other <u>device</u> options for exploring the Ayla Cloud: [Ayla on an ESP32 Dev Kit](/getting-started/ayla-on-an-esp32-dev-kit) and [Ayla on a Raspberry Pi](/getting-started/ayla-on-a-raspberry-pi). 

**Important**: Access rights associated with Ayla user accounts govern the availability of portal features. The sign-up procedure on the [Connect](../connect) page, for example, yields a user account with limited (EndUser) access rights. See [Accounts and Regions](../accounts-and-regions) to learn more.
