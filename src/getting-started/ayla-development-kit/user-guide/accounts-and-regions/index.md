## Accounts

1. Before connecting a device to the Ayla Cloud, you create an Ayla *user* account in an Ayla *cloud* account:

1. Typically, you start by creating a [user account](https://developer.aylanetworks.com/registrations/new) with *EndUser* access rights in the Ayla Public Account:

1. The Ayla Public Account is available to everyone. In it, you can experiment with an [Ayla Development Kit](/getting-started/ayla-development-kit), [Ayla on an ESP32 Dev Kit](/getting-started/ayla-on-an-esp32-dev-kit), [Ayla on a Raspberry Pi](/getting-started/ayla-on-a-raspberry-pi), and/or other device. You *connect* your device to the cloud account, and you *register* the device to your user account:
