<h3>Transcript</h3>

The Internet of Things, or IoT, is here, and it is connecting everything around us to the internet. From ceiling fans to thermostats, this network is enabling everyday devices to communicate for the very first time.

But, suppose you are a manufacturer, and you want to IoT-enable your products to provide consumers with a better user experience, or even just to learn how users are actually using your devices. Where do you start? Well, first you would need to wirelessly connect your device to the cloud by designing the necessary networking hardware and networking stack into your product. Then, you would need to develop an application, writing the software to establish and manage the communication with the cloud. And finally, to make it all work, you would also need to build a cloud that has the capabilities to support all your users and devices as you scale.

However, building this type of solution is only half the battle as it not only poses an enormous amount of risk and financial investment up front, but an ongoing challenge to maintain it as well. Fortunately, there is an alternative to building and managing this yourself. Ayla offers an end-to-end IoT platform that includes a completely managed cloud service which provides the enterprise capabilities you need to scale your deployment. The Ayla cloud requires zero cloud coding and has been built from the ground up to provide security and scale, global reach, analytics, user management, device management, alerts and notifications, data management, and more, out of the box.

The Ayla cloud also offers several pre-integrated apps, feeds, and reporting services, as well as the ability to integrate with other third-party systems to enable you to better manage your business. To connect your devices to the Ayla cloud, Ayla enables pre-programmed, fully-tested, and production-ready networking hardware through partnerships with the industry's leading chip and module manufacturers. Ayla offers support for both embedded and Linux-based applications to cover the broadest array of communication protocols, and adds no additional cost to hardware.

As for developing mobile apps that can securely control and manage your products, Ayla provides native iOS and Android libraries that support the creation of triggers, schedules & timers, registrations, account CRUD, and more. For customers looking for an even faster time to market with less on-going maintenance, Ayla offers a partially completed white-label mobile app called AMAP that provides much of the coding needed to jump start the development of primary features that consumers have come to expect from any high-performing mobile app.

For those looking for some mobile development help, Ayla has a robust ecosystem of partners who can be called on to assist with any project. Ayla's agile IoT platform abstracts the complexity of developing connected devices, and is trusted by some of the world's leading brands to sole the IoT so they can focus on what they do best. Ayla is solving the Internet of Things, so you don't have to.
