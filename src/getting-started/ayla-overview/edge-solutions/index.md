Ayla provides several types of software agents that provide secure connectivity to the Ayla Cloud for almost any device:

1. [Production Modules](production-modules)
1. [Integrated Agents](integrated-agents)
1. [Portable Agent](portable-agent)
1. [Android Agent](android-agent)
1. [Linux Agent](linux-agent)
1. [Gateway Agents](gateway-agents)

Ayla also provides Host Application Reference Code for each type of Ayla agent. Developers build solutions by modifying the reference code to suit their needs and/or copying & pasting code snippets into their existing host applications. In some cases, the host application is linked directly to the Ayla agent. In other cases, the host application communicates with the Ayla agent via serial connection or sockets.
