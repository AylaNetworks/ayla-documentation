These pages shows you how to interface with the the Ayla Datastream Service (DSS), a WebSocket server that pushes device-related events (in near real-time) from the Ayla Cloud to subscribing WebSocket clients associated (typically) with data analytics systems.

[Getting Started](getting-started) describes a sample scenario, and helps you create a virtual device, an access rule, and DSS subscriptions.

[DSS Browser](dss-browser) presents a browser-based DSS WebSocket client for experimentation and rapid learning.

[DSS Collector](dss-collector) introduces a Node.js DSS WebSocket client that can store events in files and database tables.

[DSS Events](dss-events) examines the five types of events generated by DSS. 

[DSS REST API](dss-rest-api) catalogs a REST API used for managing DSS subscriptions.
