Thank you for writing a tech note!

### Process

1. Text or email a title to Matt Hagen. Matt will send you a link to a Github folder dedicated to your tech note. The folder will contain a text file named `index.md`. The `.md` stands for [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown). 
1. Click on the `index.md` file.
1. Click on the pencil icon. If you need access rights, contact Matt for help.
1. Write your tech note. 
1. If you need to include supplemental files (e.g. image files), or if you have any questions, contact Matt for help.
1. When you are finished, contact Matt who will work with you to perfect and publish your tech note. 

### Writing tips

* Focus on writing accurate content. Don't focus on look and feel.
* Minimize the use of headings. If necessary, use Level 3 headings (`### Level 3`) to group your content as you see on this page. In most cases, this should suffice. If necessary, use Level 2 headings (`## Level 2`) to group Level 3 headings and content.
* When in doubt, write a set of steps. Each step should tell the reader to do something. And, each step should start with a verb (e.g. *Click ...*) or a prepositional phrase followed by a verb (e.g. *When you are finished, contact ...*). For an example, see the [Process](#process) section above.
