title: My New Tech Note
---

This is an example starter page for a Tech Note. Do not edit this page. If you want to write a Tech Note, create a ticket in the [Ayla Docs Jira Project](https://aylanetworks.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/AD/boards/135). Include the phrase `Tech Note` in the title of your ticket. The Ayla Docs Team will create a Github `index.md` file for your Tech Note, and send you a link to the file. Then, you can write your Tech Note in that file.
