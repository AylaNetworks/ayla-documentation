A digital twin is a cloud-based state machine that reflects the attributes, properties, and schedules of a real-world thing like a thermostat. A device event is a change in the state of a digital twin caused by an edge device, mobile app, RSS feed, schedule, or some other actor. The term *device event* refers to both (a) the occurence and (b) the record of the occurence created by the Ayla Cloud.
