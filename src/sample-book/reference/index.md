This is a <code>Chapter Summary Page</code>. Many (but not all) books contain a Reference chapter to which preceding chapters can refer. While you're here, mouse-over <code>Getting Started</code> in the sidebar, and notice that a chevron appears. Click the chevron to expand the list of pages. In this way, you can peruse the pages of a book without leaving the current page. Click [Configuration](configuration) to continue.
