## Data analytics

so when a customer wants to collect data for analytics / ml / training a model, they can save on transaction costs by enabling a statistically significant % of their device population to send data up more often, usually between 5%-15%, based on the number of devices, instead of pulling data for every device in the field. They can utilize ICC to select a segment of the population, and configure only those devices to send data up at the required rate. You can imaging they have a to device property thats called "Data_Collection_Internal_Mins", thats by default set to 120 mins, but for a segment, they can set it to 5 mins to collect more granular data for analytics.
