Wi-Fi Setup is one way to prepare for device registration. During Wi-Fi Setup, the device agent enters AP Mode in which it broadcasts the name of its wireless network. A mobile app connects to this wireless network, and tells the device the name of a wireless network that is actually connected to the network. The device agent then connects to the Ayla Cloud via this second wireless network, and obtains a registration token.
