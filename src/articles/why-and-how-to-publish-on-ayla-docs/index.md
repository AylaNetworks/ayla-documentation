title: Why (and how to) publish on Ayla Docs
---

<span class="by-line">By Matt Hagen on September 17, 2019</span>

Do you ever send emails to customers, partners, or colleagues explaining how to do Ayla-related tasks? Do you send emails explaining Ayla concepts? If so, then you can multiply your efforts by writing an [article](/articles) or [definition](/glossary) (within your area of expertise), submitting it to the Ayla Documentation Team for publication, and emailing a link to your published work instead. Others can leverage your work, too. 

Examples:

* [How to configure the Aura Mobile App](/articles/how-to-configure-the-aura-mobile-app) is an article.
* [Digital Twin](/glossary/digital-twin) is a definition.

Additionally, articles and definitions serve as building blocks for more comprehensive content on this site. 

You can do this! Please text or email me (Matt at aylanetworks.com) to get started. A member of the Ayla Documentation Team will help you through the process.
